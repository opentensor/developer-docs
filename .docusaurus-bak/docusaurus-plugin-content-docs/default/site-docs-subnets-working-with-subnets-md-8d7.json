  "description": "Subnets are composed of a discrete number of UIDs. The subnet validators and subnet miners are associated with these UIDs. Each UID in the subnet belongs to a unique hotkey which in turn is connected to a unique coldkey which was used during regisration. The Yuma Consensus runs on these UIDs.
