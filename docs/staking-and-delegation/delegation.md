# Staking in Bittensor

TAO holders can **stake** any amount of the liquidity they hold to a validator. Also known as **delegation**, staking supports validators, because their total stake in the subnet, including stake delegated to them by others, determines their consensus power and their share of emissions. After the validator/delegate extracts their **take** the remaining emissions are credited back to the stakers/delegators in proportion to their stake with that validator.

- See also [Validators: Acquiring stake](../validators/index.md#acquiring-stake).


:::tip tips
Validators/delegates can configure their take. The default value is 18%. See [Setting your delegate take](#setting-your-delegate-take).

Minimum required stake for nominators is 0.1 TAO.
:::


## Example

Suppose a validator holds 800 TAO of their own.

Then three nominators stake to the validator as follows: 
  - Nominator 1: 100 TAO.
  - Nominator 2: 70 TAO.
  - Nominator 3: 30 TAO.

The validator's effective stake is the total sum of their own and all delegated stake.

   $$
   \text{delegated stake} = 100\tau + 70\tau + 30\tau = 200\tau
   $$
   $$
   \text{total stake} = \text{self-stake} + \text{delegated stake} = 800\tau + 200\tau = 1000 \tau
   $$

Emissions to stakers are proportional to their contribution to delegated stake:

    $$
    \text{emission for staker x from validator V} = 
      \frac
      { stake_x }
      { \sum_{i \in \text{V's stakers}} \bigl(stake_i) }
    $$
- Nominator 1 represents 50% of total delegated TAO:

    $$
    \text{emission for staker x from validator V} = 
      \frac
      { 100\tau }
      { 100\tau + 70\tau + 30\tau } = 50\%
    $$ 
- Nominator 2 contributes 35% of the total delegated TAO.
      $$
      \text{emission for staker x from validator V} = 
        \frac
        { 70\tau }
        { 100\tau + 70\tau + 30\tau } = 35\%
      $$ 
- Nominator 3 contributes 15% of the total delegated TAO.
      $$
      \text{emission for staker x from validator V} = 
        \frac
        { 30\tau }
        { 100\tau + 70\tau + 30\tau } = 15\%
      $$ 

The delegate validator would keep 80% of the emissions, based on their 80% proportion of the total stake (0.8). In addition, the validator would keep their 18% take of the emissions earned on the delegated stake.

As a result:
  - Total emissions to the delegate are: $0.8 + 0.2*0.18= .836 = 83.6\%$ of the received emissions.
  - Each nominator receives the following portions of the validator's total emissions, based on their contribution percentages:
    - Nominator 1 emissions: $(1-0.8)*(1-0.18)*.5 = .082 = 8.2\%$
    - Nominator 2 emissions: $(1-0.8)*(1-0.18)*.35 = .0574 = 5.74\%$
    - Nominator 3 emissions: $(1-0.8)*(1-0.18)*.15 = .0246 = 2.46\%$
    

:::info A nominator is a delegating authority
A nominator is the same as a delegating authority. Typically, a nominator is an owner of TAO funds who wants to invest in the Bittensor network without performing any validating tasks.

## Staking operations

### Viewing available delegates 

If you are looking for trusted delegate(s) to whom you can delegate your funds, start by seeing a list of already active delegates on the Bittensor network. Run the below command on your terminal:

```bash
btcli root list_delegates
```

You will get an output like this (click on the image to zoom):

[![List Delegates](/img/docs/list_delegates_screenshot.png 'Output of List Delegates')](/img/docs/list_delegates_screenshot.png)

See below for an explanation of the column headings in the above terminal output:

## Delegate operations

### Becoming a delegate

If you are a registered subnet validator, you can become a delegate. To become a delegate:
1. You must make your hotkey available for the nominators. 
2. You must provide and sign your delegate information.

The nominators will then delegate their TAO to this hotkey, i.e., the nominators will use your delegate hotkey as a wallet destination for their delegated TAO transfers.

#### Step 1: Nominate yourself as a delegate

Run the below command (for self-nominating as a delegate):

```bash
btcli root nominate --wallet.name <my_coldkey> --wallet.hotkey <my_hotkey>
```
Example:
```bash
btcli root nominate --wallet.name test-coldkey --wallet.hotkey test-hotkey
```

#### Step 2: Provide your delegate information 

Next, provide your delegate information, such as your delegate name, URL, and description. This information will then be available in the list of active delegates, for example, when a nominator runs `btcli root list_delegates` to see available delegates.

To provide and sign this information, follow the instructions on this [Bittensor Delegates repo](https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor-delegates#2023-03-23---first-version).

### Setting your delegate take

As a delegate, you can set your delegate percentage by running the below command:

```bash
btcli root set_delegate_take --wallet.name <my_coldkey> --wallet.hotkey <my_hotkey> --take <floating point number between 0 and 1>
```
Example:
```bash
btcli root set_delegate_take --wallet.name test-coldkey --wallet.hotkey test-hotkey --take 0.1
```
where the value for the `--take` option is a floating point number between 0 and 1. In the above example, `--take 0.1` sets the delegate take to 10%.
