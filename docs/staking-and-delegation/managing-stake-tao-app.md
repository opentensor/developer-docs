## Metrics/dTAO Market Overview

The dTAO Market Overview panel gives ecosystem users and investors an overview into themany measurements for assessing various important aspects of the state of the overall TAO ecosystem. 

### Sum of Alpha Prices

The Sum of Alpha Prices is the combined value of all active subnet token prices (Alpha tokens) relative to TAO. 

#### How it works

When there's no trading activity, the AMM mechanism causes Alpha token prices to converge back toward 1, maintaining price equillibrium.
When trading is active, prices diverge &mdash often significatly &mdash based on supply/demand dynamics within each subnet's liquidity pool.
Because prices are AMM-driven, the sum can theoretically grow infinitely if there's significant buy pressure on multiple subnet at once.

#### Why it matters

The most useful aspect of this overview metric is that it can give you, as an ecosystem participant, insight into the level of speculation currently in the market overall over a given time period.

When the sum is closer to around 1 for the time period specified, it suggest that there has been little market pressure, low activity, and/or natural decay back to equilibrium between TAO and Alpha tokens.
When the sum is greater than 1 for the time period specified, it suggests that at least some subnets are experiencing buying pressure, which is driving up prices.
When there is a high sume (e.g. 10+) in a relatively short time frame, it could indicate widespread speculation, possibly even signaling a bubble, or at least high usage/subnet demand.
