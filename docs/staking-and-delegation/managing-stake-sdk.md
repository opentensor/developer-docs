# Managing Stake with Bittensor Python SDK

This pages demonstrates usage of `btcli`, the Bittensor CLI, for managing stake.

TAO holders can **stake** any amount of the liquidity they hold to a validator. Also known as **delegation**, staking supports validators, because their total stake in the subnet, including stake delegated to them by others, determines their consensus power and their share of emissions. After the validator/delegate extracts their **take** the remaining emissions are credited back to the stakers/delegators in proportion to their stake with that validator.

:::tip
Minimum transaction amount for stak/unstake/move/transfer: 500,000 RAO or 0.0005 TAO.
:::

## Check your TAO balance

To stake, you'll first need some TAO. Inquire in Discord to obtain TAO on Bittensor test network.

:::danger
The funds in a crypto wallet are only as secure as your private key and/or seed phrase, and the devices that have access to these.

Test network tokens have no real value. Before managing liquidity on Bittensor mainnet, carefully consider all aspects of secrets management and endpoint security!
:::

```python
import bittensor as bt
sub = bt.Subtensor(network="test")
wallet = bt.wallet(
    name="PracticeKey!",
    hotkey="stakinkey1",
)
wallet.unlock_coldkey()
balance = sub.get_balance(wallet.coldkey.ss58_address)
print(balance)
```

## View exchange rates

The following script displays exchange rates for a subnet alpha token, with and without slippage.

```python
import bittensor as bt

sub = bt.Subtensor(network="test")
subnet = sub.subnet(netuid=1)

print("alpha_to_tao_with_slippage", subnet.alpha_to_tao_with_slippage(100))
print("alpha_to_tao_with_slippage percentage", subnet.alpha_to_tao_with_slippage(100, percentage=True))

print("tao_to_alpha_with_slippage", subnet.tao_to_alpha_with_slippage(100))
print("tao_to_alpha_with_slippage percentage", subnet.tao_to_alpha_with_slippage(100, percentage=True))

print("tao_to_alpha", subnet.tao_to_alpha(100))
print("alpha_to_tao", subnet.alpha_to_tao(100))
```

## Register on a subnet

You can register your hotkey on a subnet using the `burned_register` method. This is necessary for staking, mining or validating.

```python
import bittensor as bt
logging = bt.logging
logging.set_info()
sub = bt.Subtensor(network="test")
wallet = bt.wallet(
    name="ExampleWalletName",
    hotkey="ExampleHotkey",
)
wallet.unlock_coldkey()
reg = sub.burned_register(wallet=wallet, netuid=3)
```

## View your registered subnets

```python
import bittensor as bt
sub = bt.Subtensor(network="test")
wallet = bt.wallet(
    name="ExampleWalletName",
    hotkey="ExampleHotkey",
)
wallet.unlock_coldkey()
netuids = sub.get_netuids_for_hotkey(wallet.hotkey.ss58_address)
print(netuids)
```

## Stake

The following script incrementally stakes 3 TAO into several subnets over many blocks:

```python

import bittensor as bt
sub = bt.Subtensor(network="test")
wallet = bt.wallet(name="ExampleWalletName")
wallet.unlock_coldkey()

to_buy = [119, 277, 18, 5] # list of netuids to stake into
increment = 0.01 # amount of TAO to stake
total_spend = 0 # total amount of TAO spent
stake = {} # dictionary to store the stake for each netuid

while total_spend < 3:
    for netuid in to_buy:
        subnet = sub.subnet(netuid)
        print(f"slippage for subnet {netuid}", subnet.slippage(increment))
        sub.add_stake( 
            wallet = wallet, 
            netuid = netuid, 
            hotkey = subnet.owner_hotkey, 
            tao_amount = increment, 
        )

        current_stake = sub.get_stake(
            coldkey_ss58 = wallet.coldkeypub.ss58_address,
            hotkey_ss58 = subnet.owner_hotkey,
            netuid = netuid,
        )
        stake[netuid] = current_stake
        total_spend += increment
        print (f'netuid {netuid} price {subnet.price} stake {current_stake}')
    sub.wait_for_block()
```

## Unstake

The below script will reverse the effects of the above, by incrementally unstaking alpha tokens from the list of subnets to yield TAO.

```python

import bittensor as bt
sub = bt.Subtensor(network="test")
wallet = bt.wallet(name="ExampleWalletName")
wallet.unlock_coldkey()

to_sell = [119, 277, 18, 5] # list of netuids to unstake from
increment = 0.01 # amount of alpha to unstake
total_sell = 0 # total amount of alpha unstaked
stake = {} # dictionary to store the stake for each netuid

while total_sell < 3:
    for netuid in to_sell:
        subnet = sub.subnet(netuid)
        print(f"slippage for subnet {netuid}", subnet.alpha_slippage(increment))

        sub.remove_stake( 
            wallet = wallet, 
            netuid = netuid, 
            hotkey = subnet.owner_hotkey, 
            amount = increment, 
        )
        current_stake = sub.get_stake(
            coldkey_ss58 = wallet.coldkeypub.ss58_address,
            hotkey_ss58 = subnet.owner_hotkey,
            netuid = netuid,
        )
        stake[netuid] = current_stake
        total_sell += increment
        print (f'netuid {netuid} price {subnet.price} stake {current_stake}')
    sub.wait_for_block()
```

## Move stake

```python

import bittensor as bt
from bittensor.core.subtensor import Subtensor
from bittensor.core.async_subtensor import AsyncSubtensor

async def main():
    async with AsyncSubtensor("test") as subtensor:

        )
        wallet.unlock_coldkey()
        success = await subtensor.move_stake(wallet = wallet,

            amount = bt.Balance.from_tao(1.0),
            wait_for_inclusion = True,
            wait_for_finalization = False,
        )
        if success:
            print("Stake was successfully moved!")
        else:
            print("Failed to move stake.")
# Because move_stake is asynchronous, we run it in an event loop:
asyncio.run(main())

```
