# Subnet 24

## Name

Cellular Automata

## Netuid
24

## Description

The primary focus of this subnet is to run, analyze, and store cellular automata to serve as a research and science accelerator. The subnet will serve as a conduit between cellular automata researchers in the scientific community and the computational resources available through the Bittensor community of miners and validators.
