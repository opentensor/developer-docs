# Subnet 2

## Name

Omron (ùúè, Œ≤)

## Netuid
2

## Description

The purpose of the Omron subnet is to provide verified AI inferences in order to optimize staking and re-staking yields.

Omron allows a variety of yield optimization models to be hosted and run against the Bittensor network while being zk-verified.

In specific, this subnet enhances the Bittensor network by providing utility to protocols and networks outside the Bittensor ecosystem. As a result, this subnet amplifies Bittensor‚Äôs mission throughout a variety of such external protocols and networks.

Furthermore, this subnet provides internal benefits by guiding Bittensor users towards the most profitable validators to delegate to. This, in turn, benefits delegators and thereby benefits the Bittensor network as a whole.
