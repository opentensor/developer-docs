# Subnet 28

## Name

Foundry S&P 500 Oracle

## Netuid
28

## Description

The Foundry S&P 500 Oracle incentivizes miners to frequently predict the S&P 500 price index during trading hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM Eastern Standard Time). This subnet serves as a suitable starting point for the traditional financial markets predictions given the S&P 500 indexâ€™s utility, accessibility, and world-wide acceptance. 

In this subnet, subnet validators send subnet miners a timestamp of a future time, for which the miners must make an S&P 500 price prediction. The miners must immediately respond with their price prediction for that given timestamp. Validators store these predictions and calculate the scores of the miners once the predictions mature. Miners then receive ranks to stack up against one another, naturally incentivizing competition.
