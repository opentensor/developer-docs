# Subnet 6

## Name

Nous Finetuning Subnet

## Netuid
6

## Description

The Nous-Bittensor subnet rewards miners for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with data generated from a continuous stream of synthetic data provided by subnet 18 (also on Bittensor). It is the first-ever continuous fine-tuning benchmark, with new data generated daily, and the first incentivized fine-tuning benchmark. 

Additionally, it is the first Bittensor subnet to perform true cross-boundary communication, where data from one subnet is utilized in a secondary subnet.
