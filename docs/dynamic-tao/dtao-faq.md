## Timing/Rollout

### What is the rollout timeline for dTao? what determines the timing?

going live to mainnet soon, global property of TAO Weight will gradually shift over 100 days

## Subnet
### What will it take to start and manage a subnet in dTao?
### Why is testnet subnet registration free (i.e., no upfront cost)? 

### How will dTao affect subnet governance (weight-setting)


### What happens when a subnet is abandoned?




### Do subnet owners control emissions for their own tokens?  

### What happens to previously locked registration costs
 “If I previously paid 100 TAO to register a subnet, do I get it back now that new subnets launch at no cost?”

## TAO-holders/Stakers



###  Are we risking “over-inflation” and price collapse?  
 “With each subnet issuing alpha, doesn’t that create a huge supply that could crash the market?”  

### What is the risk/reward staking into a subnet? "Receiving a higher emission reward vs losing your TAO if everyone sells out before you do?"

### How do you think about arbitrage between subnet tokens?
### Can users transfer alpha tokens?
### How will dTAO affect governance of the network

## Root

### Will perpetual issuance to root stakers continue after a year?  
**Q:** “Why does the root network (the main chain) keep issuing new TAO to stakers after a certain period?”  
**A:** The design includes **ongoing inflation** to maintain network security and incentivize consistent staking. Some participants question the long-term role of root issuance, but the consensus is that there must remain a baseline reward for the root network to keep validators and stakers engaged—especially as subnets proliferate.


### Is there a chance we just remove or retire the “root” network?  Why keep

### If each subnet gets its own token (alpha), doesn’t that already reflect the entire network’s value? Why keep a separate root chain at all?

### Why does the root network (the main chain) keep issuing TAO instead of just alpha?

## Miners and validators
###  How will miners (and validators) manage the proliferation of subnets? will this dilute rewards?  force them to carefully monitor and allocate their work based on subnet token value?

Emissions on each subnet depend on that subnet’s stake and TAO reserves. If a subnet has little staked TAO (or minimal external contributions), its alpha supply and emissions may be small at first. Over time, subnets with higher TAO backing and real utility should see stronger demand for their alpha tokens, which can sustain meaningful miner rewards.
