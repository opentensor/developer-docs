# Staking and Unstaking in Dynamic TAO

This page refers to the nature of staking and unstaking operations in the [Dynamic TAO model](./index.md), which is a planned evoluation of the Bittensor network.


Staking/unstaking operations are always local to a subnet and its subnet pool. 
Stake is always held in $\alpha$ token denominations. Furthermore, this $\alpha$ stake exists only in the subnet validator hotkeys.


## Staking

With dynamic TAO, staking works as follows. See the below diagram.

1. Under the dynamic TAO, as a TAO holder you would still stake to a  validator’s hotkey, but now you can also select a subnet (`netuid`) of your choice. When you run `btcli stake add` command, the TAO you want to stake first goes into the subnet pool.  
2. The TAO to be staked is added to the TAO reserves side of the subnet pool.  
3. The subnet pool algorithm uses the exchange rate and calculates the equivalent units of $\alpha$, for the TAO that was just added to the TAO reserve side. This amount of $\alpha$ is taken out of the alpha reserve of the pool and is sent to the validator’s hotkey. 
4. The validator’s hotkey holds the $\alpha$. This is referred as **Stake ($\alpha$)**. 

:::tip Stake is always expressed in alpha units
In dynamic TAO, except for the stake held in [subnet zero](#subnet-zero), the stake held by a hotkey in a subnet is always expressed in the subnet-specific $\alpha$ units and not TAO units.

## Stake or alpha outstanding
 
Total stake in the subnet is referred as $\alpha_{out}$. This is the sum of all the [Stake](#staking)  present in all the validator hotkeys in this subnet. This is often referred as **$\alpha$ outstanding**. Compare this with [$\alpha$ reserve](#tao-reserve-and-alpha-reserve), which is the amount of $α_{in}$ in the subnet pool. The $\alpha$ outstanding can change every block. See a conceptual diagram below:

## Hotkey's stake share

A hotkey's share of the total outstanding alpha tokens in the subnet is calculated as:

$$
\text{A hotkey's stake share} = \frac{\text{hotkey's stake}(\alpha)}{\text{Total stake}(\alpha_{out})\text{ in the subnet}} 
$$

:::tip Local staking power within the subnet
The hotkey's stake share represents the local stake power of the hotkey within the subnet.

## Unstaking

Unstaking works, not surprisingly, as a reverse of the staking operation. See the below diagram.

1. When you issue an unstake command, `btcli stake remove`, and specify the units of $\alpha$ token you want to unstake, this $\alpha$ is first taken out of the validator’s hotkey and added to the $\alpha$ reserves of the subnet pool. 
2. The subnet pool algorithm then applies the latest exchange rate and calculates the equivalent TAO units for the $\alpha$ token units that were just added to the $\alpha$ reserves of the pool. 
3. These equivalent TAO units are then taken out of the TAO reserves of the subnet pool and are sent to the TAO holder’s coldkey.

### Example

## Local weight or TAO Equiv

A hotkey's stake, i.e., [stake(α)](#staking), represents subnet-specific stake. As a result, a [hotkey's stake share](#hotkeys-stake-share) can only represent the validator's staking power **within the subnet**. Moreover, an $\alpha$ token of a subnet is not fungible with an $\alpha$ token of another subnet. For this very reason, when a hotkey is validating in multiple subnets, the hotkey's stake share in one subnet cannot be simply added to the same hotkey's stake share in a different subnet. 

This is where the TAO-equivalent value of the hotkeys stake share (α / α_out) comes into play. As we saw in the [Staking](#staking) section, any TAO staked into a subnet is added to the TAO reserves of the subnet pool, i.e., added to  τ_in. Similarly any TAO unstaked from a subnet is removed from the TAO reserves of the subnet pool. As a consequence, τ_in reserve represents the total voting power of the subnet as a whole. Hence, 

$$ 
\text{a subnet's total voting power}\times\text{hotkey's stake share in the subnet}
$$

represents the **hotkey's local voting power proportional to its stake share in the subnet**. It is calculated as:

$$ 
\tau_{in}\times\text{hotkey's stake share} = \tau_{in}\times\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{out}}
$$

and is expressed in TAO units. This can change every block.

:::caution Local voting power is also referred as local weight
This local voting power or local weight represents the hotkey's influence in the subnet.
:::

### Example

For example, for a validator's hotkey in a given subnet:

- Total outstanding alpha (α_out) = 30,000 alpha tokens.
- The hotkey's alpha stake ($\alpha$) = 6,000 alpha tokens.
- TAO reserve in the subnet's pool (τ_in) = 5,000 TAO.

- Then, this validator's hotkey stake share = (6,000/30,000) = 0.2 or 20%.
- Hence, this validator hotkey's local voting power, i.e., **local weight** = τ_in x hotkey's stake share = 5000 x 0.2 = 1000 TAO.

:::tip Stake share → TAO-denominated voting power
Hence, while the hotkey's stake share in this subnet is 20%, its actual local weight (local voting power) in the subnet is 1,000 TAO units. This is the power of dynamic TAO mechanism. It converts a hotkey's alpha stake share into an equivalent TAO-denominated voting power in the subnet. This makes alpha stakes comparable across different subnets, even though these subnets might have very different amounts of alpha tokens outstanding.

## Exchange Value

This is the potential instantaneous TAO you will receive, without considering slippage, if you [unstake](#unstaking) at this instant from this hotkey on this subnet. See [Swap](#swap) description. This can change every block.

:::tip Compare with TAO Equiv 
Whereas the [TAO Equiv](#local-weight-or-tao-equiv) indicates a validator's local stake weight, this Exchange Value shows TAO you will receive if you unstake now. 
:::

## Swap

This is the actual τ you will receive, after subtracting in the slippage charge, if you unstake from this hotkey now on this subnet. The slippage is calculated as:

$$
\text{Slippage} = 1 - \frac{\text{Swap(α → τ)}}{\text{Exchange Value}(α \times τ/α)}
$$

This can change every block.
