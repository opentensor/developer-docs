title: "Dynamic TAO FAQ"
---


## Timing/Rollout

### What is the rollout timeline for dTao? what determines the timing?

going live to mainnet soon, global property of TAO Weight will gradually shift over 100 days

## Subnet
### What will it take to start and manage a subnet in dTao?
### Why is testnet subnet registration free (i.e., no upfront cost)? 

### How will dTao affect subnet governance (weight-setting)


### What happens when a subnet is abandoned?




### Do subnet owners control emissions for their own tokens?  

### What happens to previously locked registration costs
 “If I previously paid 100 TAO to register a subnet, do I get it back now that new subnets launch at no cost?”

## TAO-holders/Stakers



###  Are we risking “over-inflation” and price collapse?  
 “With each subnet issuing alpha, doesn’t that create a huge supply that could crash the market?”  

### What is the risk/reward staking into a subnet? "Receiving a higher emission reward vs losing your TAO if everyone sells out before you do?"

### How do you think about arbitrage between subnet tokens?
### Can users transfer alpha tokens?
### How will dTAO affect governance of the network

---
## Root

### Will perpetual issuance to root stakers continue after a year?  
 “Why does the root network (the main chain) keep issuing new TAO to stakers after a certain period?”  



### Is there a chance we just remove or retire the “root” network?  Why keep

### If each subnet gets its own token (alpha), doesn’t that already reflect the entire network’s value? Why keep a separate root chain at all?

### Why does the root network (the main chain) keep issuing TAO instead of just alpha?

## Miners and validators
###  How will miners (and validators) manage the proliferation of subnets? will this dilute rewards?  force them to carefully monitor and allocate their work based on subnet token value?
