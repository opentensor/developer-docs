# Dynamic TAO

Dynamic TAO is a sophisticated mechanism that brings the following benefits to the Bittensor network: 

- Eliminates the role of the centralized root network. 
- Enables a TAO holder to directly participate in a subnet of their choice.
- Creates an efficient way to evaluate a subnet's performance via the subnet-specific dynamic TAO token (dTAO). A dTAO token is exchangeable with TAO.
- Incorporates the consensus power of a subnet validator into their dTAO token stake holdings. 
- Uses a subnet's dTAO to determine emissions to the subnet. 

Furthermore, the dynamic TAO enables a TAO holder and a subnet validator to manage their stake, influence, and governance across multiple subnets in the Bittensor network. By making use of the global component of a subnet validator's stake weight, the dynamic TAO elegantly solves the problem of managing influence of a validator, hence of a TAO holder, across different subnet economies while maintaining mathematical consistency and economic incentives.
