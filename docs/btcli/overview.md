# Bittensor CLI Overview

The Bittensor command line interface (CLI), `btcli`, provides the simplest way to interact with the Bittensor network and its subnets from the command line. This includes managing [wallets (coldkeys and hotkeys)](../getting-started/wallets), TAO balances, transfer, staking and unstaking functions, node registration, governance functions, and more.
