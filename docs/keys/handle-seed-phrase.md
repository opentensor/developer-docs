# Handle your Seed Phrase/Mnemonic Securely

The seed phrase (a.k.a. 'menemonic' or 'recovery phrase') is a series of (at least 12) words that is generated together with your wallet's cryptographic key pair, and which can be used to recover the coldkey private key. This seed phrase is therefore a human-usable way to save access to the cryptographic wallet offline, and to import the cryptographic wallet into a wallet application.

## Do not leak your seed phrase

1. Do not keep paper/analog copies somewhere they can be accessed without your knowledge.
1. Do not expose your seed phrase to untrustworthy software by entering into apps:
	- messaging
	- email
	- online word processors
1. Beware key-loggers, especially if you enter your seed phrase.
1. Beward cameras and eye-balls (the "over the shoulder" attack) if you generate and export your seed phrase.

## Do not lose your keys/seed phrase

You must keep redundant backups of your coldkey. If you lose all access to your seed phrase/initialized wallets, you permanently and unrecoverably lose access to your account (TAO, stake, etc.). 

Common approaches:
- **Paper backups** of the mnemonic phrase, sealed in tamper-evident envelopes and locked in a safety deposit box or safe.
- **Encrypted USB drives** with strong passphrases stored in a safety deposit box or safe.  
- **Multiple locations strategy** so that a single disaster (fire or flood) cannot destroy all copies.
