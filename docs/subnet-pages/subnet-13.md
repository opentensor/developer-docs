# Subnet 13

## Name

Data Universe

## Netuid
13

## Description

Data Universe subnet collects and stores large amounts of data from across a wide-range of sources, for use by other Subnets. This subnet is built from the ground-up with a focus on decentralization and scalability. There is no centralized entity that controls the data; the data is stored across all Miner's on the network and is queryable via the Validators. 

At launch, Data Universe is able to support up to 50 Petabytes of data across 200 miners, while only requiring ~10GB of storage on the Validator.
