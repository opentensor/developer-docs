# Subnet 32

## Name

BitAudit - Blockchain Network Audit Subnet

## Netuid
32

## Description

The objective of this subnet is to conduct audits on smart contracts, aiming to detect security vulnerabilities, address poor coding practices, and optimize inefficient code through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI).

This subnet aims to offer a service that safeguards users against potential financial losses, compromised data, and reputational damage, thereby bolstering the security, reliability, and performance of blockchain networks utilizing Bittensor Ecosystem.

This subnet will be further extended to audit blockchain networks. Additionally, this is the first Bittensor subnet to handle software security using AI.
