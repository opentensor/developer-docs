# Subnet 27

## Name

Compute Subnet

## Netuid
27

## Description

This is a compute-composable subnet, integrating various cloud platforms (e.g., Runpod, Lambda, AWS) into a cohesive unit. Its purpose is to enable higher-level cloud platforms to offer seamless compute composability across different underlying platforms. 

With the proliferation of cloud platforms, there's a growing need for a subnet that can seamlessly integrate these platforms, allowing efficient resource sharing and allocation. This compute-composable subnet empowers nodes to contribute computational power, with validators ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the shared resources.
