# Subnet 2

## Name

Omron (𝜏, β)

## Netuid
2

## Description

The purpose of the Omron subnet is to provide verified AI inferences to optimize staking and re-staking yields.
Omron allows a variety of yield optimization models to be hosted and run against the network while being zk-verified.
Specifically, this subnet enhances the Bittensor network as a whole by providing external uses for protocols outside the Bittensor ecosystem; thereby amplifying bittensor’s mission throughout a variety of external networks.
As well, this subnet provides internal uses for guiding bittensor users towards the most profitable validators to delegate to which benefits delegators and thereby the network as a whole.
