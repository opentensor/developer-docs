# Bittensor Developer Documentation

**Welcome!** Bittensor is a protocol for decentralized subnets. Each subnet is an incentive-based competition in action. Subnets run on blockchain and constitute the core of the Bittensor ecosystem. **The rewards for subnet participants are in the form of TAO tokens.** 

You can either create your custom incentive mechanism for your own competition or join a competition that already exists in the Bittensor ecosystem. For example, the [text prompting subnet](https://github.com/opentensor/text-prompting) incentivizes subnet miners that produce the best prompt completions in response to the prompts sent by the subnet validators in that subnet. 

Bittensor provides all the open source tools, codebase and the documentation, with step-by-step tutorials and guides, to enable you to participate in the Bittensor ecosystem.
