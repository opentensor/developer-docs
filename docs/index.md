# Bittensor Developer Documentation

Welcome! Bittensor is an open source platform where participants harvest TAO for producting best-in-class digital commodities, including compute power, storage space, artificial intelligence (AI) inference and training, protein folding, financial markets prediction, and many more.

Digital commodities are produced in many distinct **subnets**. Each subnet is an independent community of miners (who produce the commodity), and validators (who evaluate the miners' work).

The Bittensor network constantly emits liquidity in the form of its token, TAO ($\tau$), which is harvested by participants in proportion to the value of their contributions. Participants include:

- **Miners**&mdash;Work to produce digital commodities. See [Validating and Mining](./subnets/checklist-for-validating-mining).
- **Validators**&mdash;Evaluate the quality of miners' work. See [Validating and Mining](./subnets/checklist-for-validating-mining)
- **Subnet Creators**&mdash;Manage the incentive mechanisms that specify the work miners and validate must perform and evaluate, respectively. See [Create a Subnet](./subnets/create-a-subnet)
- **Stakers**&mdash;TAO holders can support specific validators by staking TAO to them. See [Staking and Delegation](./staking-and-delegation).
