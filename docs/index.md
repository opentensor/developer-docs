# Bittensor Developer Documentation

**Welcome!** Bittensor is a protocol for decentralized subnets. Subnets exist to produce decentralized intelligence. Each subnet is an incentive-based competition in action, to produce the best decentralized intelligence. 

Subnets run on blockchain and constitute the core of the Bittensor ecosystem. **The rewards for subnet participants are in the form of TAO tokens.** 

You can either create your own subnet, with your custom incentive mechanism, to launch your own competition, or join a subnet that already exists in the Bittensor ecosystem. For example, the [text prompting subnet](https://github.com/opentensor/text-prompting) incentivizes subnet miners who produce the best prompt completions in response to the prompts sent by the subnet validators in that subnet. 

Bittensor provides all the open source tools, the codebase and the documentation, with step-by-step tutorials and guides, to enable you to participate in the Bittensor ecosystem.
