# Bittensor Developer Documentation

**Welcome!** Bittensor is an open source platform on which you can produce competitive digital commodities. These digital commodities can be machine intelligence, storage space, compute power, protein folding, financial markets prediction, and many more. **You are rewarded in TAO** when you produce best digital commodities.

Each category of the digital commodity is produced in a distinct **subnet**. Applications are built on these specific subnets. End-users of these applications would be served by these applications.

Subnets, which exist outside the blockchain and are connected to it, are off-chain competitions where only the best producers are rewarded. A subnet consists of off-chain **subnet validators** who initiate the competition for a specific digital commodity, and off-chain **subnet miners** who compete and respond by producing the best quality digital commodity. 

Scores are assigned to the top subnet miners and subnet validators. The on-chain Yuma Consensus determines **the TAO rewards for these top performers**. The Bittensor blockchain, called **subtensor**, runs on decentralized validation nodes, just like any blockchain. 

For example, in the [Subnet 1 Prompting](https://github.com/opentensor/prompting) the subnet miners compete to generate answers that are closest to a machine learning base model chosen by the subnet validators. 

Opentensor Foundation provides all the open source tools, the codebase and the documentation, with step-by-step tutorials and guides, to enable you to participate in the Bittensor ecosystem. 

:::danger This documentation is for bittensor platform only

This documentation and the Bittensor codebase is for the Bittensor platform only. For subnets and applications, refer to subnet-specific websites, which are maintained by subnet owners.

## Start here

If you are new to Bittensor, start by learning the concepts. Then install the Bittensor software and create a wallet. Follow the below links.

    body='To validate or mine, or run your own subnet, install Bittensor and create wallet to get started.' />

:::tip How to participate
A straightforward way to participate in the Bittensor network is to be a subnet miner or a subnet validator in an existing subnet. It is not necessary to create a subnet. Follow the below links in the [Validate or mine](#validate-or-mine) section. Alternately, if you want to create your own custom incentive mechanism, then you create your own subnet and launch your own competition. See the below [Running a subnet](#running-a-subnet) section.
