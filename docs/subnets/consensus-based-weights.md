# Consensus-based Weights

This guide describes how to use the **consensus-based weights** feature (also called "liquid alpha"). 

With this feature, the dividends to a subnet validator are better correlated to the performance of the subnet miner on which the subnet validator is setting the weights. In this context, see also the documentation for the [Commit Reveal](./commit-reveal.md) feature, as both these features help the subnet validators in finding new subnet miners that perform well and bonding to them quickly.

## Description

Currently while calculating the dividends to a subnet validator, a quantity called $\Delta B_{ij}$, defined as an **instantaneous bond value** of a subnet validator $i$ with the subnet miner $j$, is used.

A subnet validator maintains an instantaneous bond value on each subnet miner. However, while calculating a subnet validator's dividends, instead of directly using the instantaneous bond value $\Delta B_{ij}$, we use $B_{ij}^{(t)}$, an **exponential moving average (EMA)** of the bond value, weighted over the current epoch and the previous epoch. See the below equation for how this EMA is computed, where $t$ is the current epoch time and $t-1$ is the previous epoch time:

$$
B_{ij}^{(t)} = \alpha\cdot\Delta B_{ij}^{(t)} + (1-\alpha)\cdot B_{ij}^{(t-1)}
$$

This EMA, $B_{ij}^{(t)}$, helps in early discovery of promising subnet miners and prevents abrupt changes to the bond value. Normally any abrupt change in the bond value indicates exploitation. 

Finally, the **dividend $D_i$ to a subnet validator $i$** is calculated as:

$$
D_i = \sum_j B_{ij} \cdot I_j
$$ 

where $B_{ij}$ is the EMA bond value of the subnet validator $i$ with the subnet miner $j$, and $I_j$ is the subnet miner's incentive. See the subtensor document section, [Validator bonding](https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/blob/main/docs/consensus.md#validator-bonding) for a rigorous mathematical treatment of this topic. 

### What changed with this feature

Without the consensus-based weights feature, the $\alpha$ in the above equation is set to `0.9`. With the consensus-based weights feature, this $\alpha$ value is made into a variable. An optimium value for the variable $\alpha$ is determined based on the current consensus (YC-2) in a given subnet. Hence this feature is called **consensus-based weights**.

Using the new subnet hyperparameters that are described below, a subnet owner should experiment and discover the optimum $\alpha$ for their subnet. 

## Installing the test consensus-based weights feature

The consensus-based weights feature is available only at the below testnet URL and the specified subtensor and bittensor repo branches:

- **Testnet URL**: `wss://test.finney.opentensor.ai:443/`.

    1. First make sure you do `git pull master` to pull the latest changes from the Bittensor repo `https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor`. 
    2. Next, switch to `rc_7.3.0` branch. 
    3. Then install Bittensor by running the below command:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Using the test consensus-based weights feature

### Summary steps

Here are summary steps to use the consensus-based weights feature.Â These steps are typically executed by a subnet owner:

1. To activate this feature, a subnet owner should set the `liquid_alpha_enabled` (bool) hyperparameter to `True`.
2. Next, the subnet owner should set the upper and lower bounds for $\alpha$ by using a single subnet hyperparameter, `alpha_values` (List[int]). 

:::danger you must set both low and high alpha values together. See below.

## Default values, allowed ranges and value format

### Default values

- Default value for `alpha_low` is `0.7`.
- Default value for `alpha_high` is `0.9`.
- Default value for `liquid_alpha_enabled` is `False`.

### Allowed ranges

- The range for both `alpha_low` and `alpha_high` hyperparameters is `(0,1)`.
- However, **until further notice**, the `alpha_high` value must be greater than or equal to `0.8`.
- The value of `alpha_low` must not be greater than or equal to `alpha_high`.

### Value format

When you set the subnet hyperparameters `alpha_low` and `alpha_high`, you must pass their integer equivalents in `u16`. This applies whether you set these hyperparameters using the `btcli` command or in your Python code. These integer values are then converted by the subtensor into their corresponding decimal values in the `u16` format. 

Use the below conversion formula to determine the integer values for your desired decimal values for both `alpha_low` and `alpha_high` hyperparameters.

$$ 
\text{Integer value} = \text{(your-desired-decimal-value)} \times 65536
$$

Hence, for example:
- If you want `alpha_low` to be `0.1`, then you would pass `6554`, which is the rounded up value of `0.1 * 65536`. 
- If you want `alpha_high` to be `0.8`, then you would pass `52429`, which is the rounded up value of `0.8 * 65536`.

## Detailed steps using Python code

### Method signatures

See below the Python definitions for the consensus-based weights feature:

```python
import bittensor as bt
    # Enable consensus-based weights (liquid alpha) feature
    enabled_result = bt.subtensor.set_hyperparameter(
        wallet=wallet,
        netuid=netuid,
        parameter="liquid_alpha_enabled",
        value=value,
        wait_for_inclusion=True,
        wait_for_finalization=True,
    )
    # Set alpha_values as a list of integers passed to "value" parameter in this order: alpha_low, alpha_high
    alpha_low_high_result = bt.subtensor.set_hyperparameter(
        wallet=wallet,
        netuid=netuid,
        parameter="alpha_values",
        value=[],
        wait_for_inclusion=True,
        wait_for_finalization=True,
    )
```

### Example Python code

Below is the example Python code showing how to use the above definitions for the commit reveal feature:

```python
    import bittensor as bt
    # Enable consensus-based weights (liquid alpha) feature
    enabled_result = bt.subtensor.set_hyperparameter(
        wallet=wallet,
        netuid=netuid,
        parameter="liquid_alpha_enabled",
        value=True,
        wait_for_inclusion=True,
        wait_for_finalization=True,
    )
    # Set alpha low and high values
    alpha_low_high_result = bt.subtensor.set_hyperparameter(
        wallet=wallet,
        netuid=netuid,
        parameter="alpha_values",
        value=[6554, 52429], # decimal 0.1 for alpha_low and 0.8 for alpha_high
        wait_for_inclusion=True,
        wait_for_finalization=True,
    )
```

:::danger you must always set alpha_low and alpha_high together
You must set the values for both `alpha_low` and `alpha_high` together. Current functionality does not allow setting a value to only one of `alpha_low` or `alpha_high`. For example, if you want to set a new value to `alpha_low` but do not want to change the `alpha_high` value, you must set the new value to `alpha_low` and also set again the current, unchanging value to `alpha_high`.

## Detailed steps using `btcli`

### Set the subnet hyperparameters

#### 1. Enable the consensus-based weights feature

**Syntax**

```bash
btcli sudo set hyperparameters --netuid <NETUID> --param liquid_alpha_enabled --value <True or False>
```

**Example**

For subnet 1 (`netuid` of `1`):

```bash
btcli sudo set hyperparameters --netuid 1 --param liquid_alpha_enabled --value True
```
or you can also use,

```bash
btcli sudo set
```
and follow the terminal prompts. 

:::info tip
When you use `btcli sudo set` you can use `1` or `0` to enable or disable the `liquid_alpha_enabled` hyperparameter. You can also use `true` or `True`, or `false` or `False`. 
:::

#### 2. Use the `alpha_values` to set the `alpha_low` and `alpha_high`

**Syntax**

```bash
btcli sudo set hyperparameters --netuid <NETUID> --param alpha_values --value <value-of-alpha_low, value-of-alpha_high>
```

**Example**

Setting the value of `alpha_low` to the decimal `0.1` (integer `6554`) and `alpha_high` to the decimal `0.8` (integer `52429`) for subnet 1 (`netuid` of `1`):

```bash
btcli sudo set hyperparameters --netuid 1 --param alpha_values --value 6554, 52429
```

Now if you want to only change the `alpha_high` value from `0.8` to `0.85` (integer `55706`) then: 

First execute the `btcli sudo set` command and provide the `netuid`. The terminal will display the current values of `alpha_low` and `alpha_high`. 

:::warning alert
When you use `btcli sudo set` the display will not show `alpha_values` parameter. It will only show `alpha_low` and `alpha_high` parameters.
:::

Use the current value of `alpha_low` from the above display, and the new desired value of `alpha_high` and set both like below:

```bash
btcli sudo set hyperparameters --netuid 1 --param alpha_values --value 6554, 55706
```
