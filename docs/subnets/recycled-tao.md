## Recycling, burning, and locking

"Recycling TAO" means that this TAO is put back into the Bittensor emissions system. Instead of minting new TAO this recycled TAO that is in the recycle bin will be used again in the new emissions.

This happens in two cases:

- When you register either as a subnet validator or a subnet miner and get a `UID` in return, the registration cost TAO you pay is recycled. 
- Emissions are recycled for those subnets that have registration turned off or paused.

When TAO is burned it is permanently removed from circulation, reducing total supply.

Locked TAO is neither recycled nor burned, but held unspent, without the ability to move it until it is unlocked. The cost for subnet registration is locked and returned if the subnet is deregistered.
