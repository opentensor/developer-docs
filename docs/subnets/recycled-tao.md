# Recycled TAO

This document explains the terms "recycled TAO" and related terms.

## TAO is recycled

The phrase "recycled TAO" means that this TAO is put back into the Bittensor emissions system. Instead of minting new TAO this recycled TAO that is in the recycle bin will be used again in the new emissions. 

- **UID registration costs**: When you register either as a subnet validator or a subnet miner and get a `UID` in return, the registration cost TAO you pay is recycled. 
- Emissions are recycled for those subnets that have registration turned off or paused.

## TAO is burned

Any TAO that is burned is permanently removed from the circulation.

## TAO is spent

Another way of saying "TAO is recycled". 

## TAO is locked

This is different from recycling TAO. The locked TAO is neither recycled nor burned. The locked TAO is held in a coldkey.

**Netuid registration costs**: When you create a subnet and get a `netuid` in return, this subnet registration cost TAO you pay is returned to you when the subnet is deregistered. In the meantime this TAO is locked.
