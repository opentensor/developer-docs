.. py:class:: Synapse(/, **data)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pydantic.BaseModel`


   Represents a Synapse in the Bittensor network, serving as a communication schema between neurons (nodes).

   Synapses ensure the format and correctness of transmission tensors according to the Bittensor protocol.
   Each Synapse type is tailored for a specific machine learning (ML) task, following unique compression and
   communication processes. This helps maintain sanitized, correct, and useful information flow across the network.

   The Synapse class encompasses essential network properties such as HTTP route names, timeouts, request sizes, and
   terminal information. It also includes methods for serialization, deserialization, attribute setting, and hash
   computation, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange in the network.

   The class includes Pydantic validators and root validators to enforce data integrity and format. Additionally,
   properties like ``is_success``, ``is_failure``, ``is_timeout``, etc., provide convenient status checks based on
   dendrite responses.

   Think of Bittensor Synapses as glorified pydantic wrappers that have been designed to be used in a distributed
   network. They provide a standardized way to communicate between neurons, and are the primary mechanism for
   communication between neurons in Bittensor.

   Key Features:

   1. HTTP Route Name (``name`` attribute):
       Enables the identification and proper routing of requests within the network. Essential for users
       defining custom routes for specific machine learning tasks.

   2. Query Timeout (``timeout`` attribute):
       Determines the maximum duration allowed for a query, ensuring timely responses and network
       efficiency. Crucial for users to manage network latency and response times, particularly in
       time-sensitive applications.

   3. Request Sizes (``total_size``, ``header_size`` attributes):
       Keeps track of the size of request bodies and headers, ensuring efficient data transmission without
       overloading the network. Important for users to monitor and optimize the data payload, especially
       in bandwidth-constrained environments.

   4. Terminal Information (``dendrite``, ``axon`` attributes):
       Stores information about the dendrite (receiving end) and axon (sending end), facilitating communication
       between nodes. Users can access detailed information about the communication endpoints, aiding in
       debugging and network analysis.

   5. Body Hash Computation (``computed_body_hash``, ``required_hash_fields``):
       Ensures data integrity and security by computing hashes of transmitted data. Provides users with a
       mechanism to verify data integrity and detect any tampering during transmission.
       It is recommended that names of fields in `required_hash_fields` are listed in the order they are
       defined in the class.

   6. Serialization and Deserialization Methods:
       Facilitates the conversion of Synapse objects to and from a format suitable for network transmission.
       Essential for users who need to customize data formats for specific machine learning models or tasks.

   7. Status Check Properties (``is_success``, ``is_failure``, ``is_timeout``, etc.):
       Provides quick and easy methods to check the status of a request, improving error handling and
       response management. Users can efficiently handle different outcomes of network requests, enhancing
       the robustness of their applications.

   Example usage::

       # Creating a Synapse instance with default values
       synapse = Synapse()

       # Setting properties and input
       synapse.timeout = 15.0
       synapse.name = "MySynapse"
       # Not setting fields that are not defined in your synapse class will result in an error, e.g.:
       synapse.dummy_input = 1 # This will raise an error because dummy_input is not defined in the Synapse class

       # Get a dictionary of headers and body from the synapse instance
       synapse_dict = synapse.model_dump_json()

       # Get a dictionary of headers from the synapse instance
       headers = synapse.to_headers()

       # Reconstruct the synapse from headers using the classmethod 'from_headers'
       synapse = Synapse.from_headers(headers)

       # Deserialize synapse after receiving it over the network, controlled by `deserialize` method
       deserialized_synapse = synapse.deserialize()

       # Checking the status of the request
       if synapse.is_success:
           print("Request succeeded")

       # Checking and setting the status of the request
       print(synapse.axon.status_code)
       synapse.axon.status_code = 408 # Timeout

   :param name: HTTP route name, set on :func:`axon.attach`.

   standardized communication in a decentralized environment.

   Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments.

   Raises [`ValidationError`][pydantic_core.ValidationError] if the input data cannot be
   validated to form a valid model.

   `self` is explicitly positional-only to allow `self` as a field name.


   .. py:attribute:: model_config

      Configuration for the model, should be a dictionary conforming to [`ConfigDict`][pydantic.config.ConfigDict].


   .. py:attribute:: _model_json_schema
      :type:  ClassVar[Dict[str, Any]]


   .. py:method:: deserialize()

      Deserializes the Synapse object.

      This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses for custom deserialization logic.
      In the context of the Synapse superclass, this method simply returns the instance itself.
      When inheriting from this class, subclasses should provide their own implementation for
      deserialization if specific deserialization behavior is desired.

      By default, if a subclass does not provide its own implementation of this method, the
      Synapse's deserialize method will be used, returning the object instance as-is.

      In its default form, this method simply returns the instance of the Synapse itself without any modifications. Subclasses of Synapse can override this method to add specific deserialization behaviors, such as converting serialized data back into complex object types or performing additional data integrity checks.

      Example::

          class CustomSynapse(Synapse):
              additional_data: str

              def deserialize(self) -> "CustomSynapse":
                  # Custom deserialization logic
                  # For example, decoding a base64 encoded string in 'additional_data'
                  if self.additional_data:
                      self.additional_data = base64.b64decode(self.additional_data).decode('utf-8')
                  return self

          serialized_data = '{"additional_data": "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ="}'  # Base64 for 'Hello World'
          custom_synapse = CustomSynapse.model_validate_json(serialized_data)
          deserialized_synapse = custom_synapse.deserialize()

          # deserialized_synapse.additional_data would now be 'Hello World'

      :returns: The deserialized Synapse object. In this default implementation, it returns the object itself.
      :rtype: Synapse

      overridden by the user or malicious code.



   .. py:method:: get_total_size()

      Get the total size of the current object.

      This method first calculates the size of the current object, then assigns it
      to the instance variable :func:`self.total_size` and finally returns this value.

      :returns: The total size of the current object.
      :rtype: int



   .. py:property:: is_success
      :type: bool

      Checks if the dendrite's status code indicates success.

      This method returns ``True`` if the status code of the dendrite is ``200``,
      which typically represents a successful HTTP request.

      :returns: ``True`` if dendrite's status code is ``200``, ``False`` otherwise.
      :rtype: bool


   .. py:property:: is_failure
      :type: bool

      Checks if the dendrite's status code indicates failure.

      This method returns ``True`` if the status code of the dendrite is not ``200``,

      :rtype: bool


   .. py:property:: is_blacklist
      :type: bool

      Checks if the dendrite's status code indicates a blacklisted request.

      This method returns ``True`` if the status code of the dendrite is ``403``,
      which is the HTTP status code for a forbidden request.

      :returns: ``True`` if dendrite's status code is ``403``, ``False`` otherwise.
      :rtype: bool


   .. py:property:: failed_verification
      :type: bool

      The schema is stored in the class variable ``_model_json_schema`` and is only
      generated once to improve performance.

      :returns: The JSON schema for the Synapse model.
      :rtype: dict



   .. py:method:: get_required_fields()

      Get the required fields from the model's JSON schema.



   .. py:method:: to_headers()

      Converts the state of a Synapse instance into a dictionary of HTTP headers.

      This method is essential for
      packaging Synapse data for network transmission in the Bittensor framework, ensuring that each key aspect of
      the Synapse is represented in a format suitable for HTTP communication.

      Process:

      1. Basic Information: It starts by including the ``name`` and ``timeout`` of the Synapse, which are fundamental for identifying the query and managing its lifespan on the network.
      2. Complex Objects: The method serializes the ``axon`` and ``dendrite`` objects, if present, into strings. This serialization is crucial for preserving the state and structure of these objects over the network.
      3. Encoding: Non-optional complex objects are serialized and encoded in base64, making them safe for HTTP transport.
      4. Size Metrics: The method calculates and adds the size of headers and the total object size, providing valuable information for network bandwidth management.

      Example Usage::

          synapse = Synapse(name="ExampleSynapse", timeout=30)
          headers = synapse.to_headers()
          # headers now contains a dictionary representing the Synapse instance

      :returns: A dictionary containing key-value pairs representing the Synapse's properties, suitable for HTTP communication.
      :rtype: dict



   .. py:property:: body_hash
      :type: str

      Computes a SHA3-256 hash of the serialized body of the Synapse instance.

      This hash is used to
      ensure the data integrity and security of the Synapse instance when it's transmitted across the
      network. It is a crucial feature for verifying that the data received is the same as the data sent.

      Process:

      1. Iterates over each required field as specified in ``required_hash_fields``.
      2. Concatenates the string representation of these fields.
      3. Applies SHA3-256 hashing to the concatenated string to produce a unique fingerprint of the data.

      Example::

          synapse = Synapse(name="ExampleRoute", timeout=10)
          hash_value = synapse.body_hash
          # hash_value is the SHA3-256 hash of the serialized body of the Synapse instance

      :returns: The SHA3-256 hash as a hexadecimal string, providing a fingerprint of the Synapse instance's data for integrity checks.
      :rtype: str


   .. py:method:: parse_headers_to_inputs(headers)
      :classmethod:


      Interprets and transforms a given dictionary of headers into a structured dictionary, facilitating the reconstruction of Synapse objects.

      This method is essential for parsing network-transmitted
      data back into a Synapse instance, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

      Process:

      1. Separates headers into categories based on prefixes (``axon``, ``dendrite``, etc.).
      2. Decodes and deserializes ``input_obj`` headers into their original objects.
      3. Assigns simple fields directly from the headers to the input dictionary.

      Example::

          received_headers = {
              'bt_header_axon_address': '127.0.0.1',
              'bt_header_dendrite_port': '8080',
              # Other headers...
          }
          inputs = Synapse.parse_headers_to_inputs(received_headers)
          # inputs now contains a structured representation of Synapse properties based on the headers

      .. note:: This is handled automatically when calling :func:`Synapse.from_headers(headers)` and does not need to be called directly.

      :param headers: The headers dictionary to parse.
      :type headers: dict

      :returns: A structured dictionary representing the inputs for constructing a Synapse instance.
      :rtype: dict



   .. py:method:: from_headers(headers)
      :classmethod:


      Constructs a new Synapse instance from a given headers dictionary, enabling the re-creation of the Synapse's state as it was prior to network transmission.

      This method is a key part of the
      deserialization process in the Bittensor network, allowing nodes to accurately reconstruct Synapse
      objects from received data.

      Example::

          received_headers = {
              'bt_header_axon_address': '127.0.0.1',
              'bt_header_dendrite_port': '8080',
              # Other headers...
          }
          synapse = Synapse.from_headers(received_headers)
          # synapse is a new Synapse instance reconstructed from the received headers

      :param headers: The dictionary of headers containing serialized Synapse information.
      :type headers: dict

      :returns: A new instance of Synapse, reconstructed from the parsed header information, replicating the original instance's state.
      :rtype: Synapse
