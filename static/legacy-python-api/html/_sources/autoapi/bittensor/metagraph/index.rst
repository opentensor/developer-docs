      :type: Union[numpy.typing.NDArray, bittensor.utils.registration.torch.nn.Parameter]

      Represents the weights assigned to each neuron in the Bittensor network. In the context of Bittensor,
      weights are crucial for determining the influence and interaction between neurons. Each neuron is responsible
      for setting its weights, which are then recorded on a digital ledger. These weights are reflective of the
      neuron's assessment or judgment of other neurons in the network.

      The weight matrix :math:`W = [w_{ij}]` is a key component of the network's architecture, where the :math:`i^{th}` row is set by
      neuron :math:`i` and represents its weights towards other neurons. These weights influence the ranking and incentive
      mechanisms within the network. Higher weights from a neuron towards another can imply greater trust or value
      placed on that neuron's contributions.

      :returns: A tensor of inter-peer weights, where each element :math:`w_{ij}` represents the weight assigned by neuron :math:`i` to neuron :math:`j`. This matrix is fundamental to the network's functioning, influencing the distribution of incentives and the inter-neuronal dynamics.

          Used internally to process and set weights or bonds for the neurons::

              self.weights = self._process_weights_or_bonds(raw_weights_data, "weights")



   .. py:method:: _set_metagraph_attributes(block, subtensor)
      :abstractmethod:



   .. py:method:: _process_root_weights(data, attribute, subtensor)

      Specifically processes the root weights data for the metagraph. This method is similar to :func:`_process_weights_or_bonds` but is tailored for processing root weights, which have a different structure and significance in the network.

      :param data: The raw root weights data to be processed.
      :param attribute: A string indicating the attribute type, here it's typically ``weights``.
      :param subtensor: The subtensor instance used for additional data and context needed in processing.

      :returns: A tensor parameter encapsulating the processed root weights data.

      Internal Usage:
          Used internally to process and set root weights for the metagraph::

              self.root_weights = self._process_root_weights(
                  raw_root_weights_data, "weights", subtensor
                  )




   .. py:method:: save()

      Saves the current state of the metagraph to a file on disk. This function is crucial for persisting the current state of the network's metagraph, which can later be reloaded or analyzed. The save operation includes all neuron attributes and parameters, ensuring a complete snapshot of the metagraph's state.

      :returns: The metagraph instance after saving its state.
      :rtype: metagraph

      .. admonition:: Example

         Save the current state of the metagraph to the default directory::
         
             metagraph.save()
         
         The saved state can later be loaded to restore or analyze the metagraph's state at this point.
         
         If using the default save path::
         
             metagraph.load()
         
         If using a custom save path::
         
             metagraph.load_from_path(dir_path)



   .. py:method:: load()

      Loads the state of the metagraph from the default save directory. This method is instrumental for restoring the metagraph to its last saved state. It automatically identifies the save directory based on the ``network`` and ``netuid`` properties of the metagraph, locates the latest block file in that directory, and loads all metagraph parameters from it.

      This functionality is particularly beneficial when continuity in the state of the metagraph is necessary
      across different runtime sessions, or after a restart of the system. It ensures that the metagraph reflects
      the exact state it was in at the last save point, maintaining consistency in the network's representation.

      The method delegates to ``load_from_path``, supplying it with the directory path constructed from the metagraph's current ``network`` and ``netuid`` properties. This abstraction simplifies the process of loading the metagraph's state for the user, requiring no direct path specifications.

      :returns: The metagraph instance after loading its state from the default directory.
      :rtype: metagraph

      .. admonition:: Example

         Load the metagraph state from the last saved snapshot in the default directory::
         
             metagraph.load()
         
         After this operation, the metagraph's parameters and neuron data are restored to their state at the time of the last save in the default directory.

      .. note:: The default save directory is determined based on the metagraph's ``network`` and ``netuid`` attributes. It is important to ensure that these attributes are set correctly and that the default save directory contains the appropriate state files for the metagraph.



   .. py:method:: load_from_path(dir_path)
      :abstractmethod:


      Loads the state of the metagraph from a specified directory path. This method is crucial for restoring the metagraph to a specific state based on saved data. It locates the latest block file in the given
      directory and loads all metagraph parameters from it. This is particularly useful for analyses that require historical states of the network or for restoring previous states of the metagraph in different
      execution environments.

      The method first identifies the latest block file in the specified directory, then loads the metagraph state including neuron attributes and parameters from this file. This ensures that the metagraph is accurately reconstituted to reflect the network state at the time of the saved block.

      :param dir_path: The directory path where the metagraph's state files are stored. This path should contain one or more saved state files, typically named in a format that includes the block number.
      :type dir_path: str

      :returns: The metagraph instance after loading its state from the specified directory path.
      :rtype: metagraph

      .. admonition:: Example

         Load the metagraph state from a specific directory::
         
             dir_path = "/path/to/saved/metagraph/states"
             metagraph.load_from_path(dir_path)
         
         The metagraph is now restored to the state it was in at the time of the latest saved block in the specified directory.

      .. note::

         This method assumes that the state files in the specified directory are correctly formatted and
         contain valid data for the metagraph. It is essential to ensure that the directory path and the
         state files within it are accurate and consistent with the expected metagraph structure.
